      info        : "The Netlogon Remote Protocol (also called MS-NRPC) is an RPC interface that is used exclusively by domain-joined devices. MS-NRPC includes an authentication method and a method of establishing a Netlogon secure channel. These updates enforce the specified Netlogon client behavior to use secure RPC with Netlogon secure channel between member computers and Active Directory (AD) domain controllers (DC).

This security update addresses the vulnerability by enforcing secure RPC when using the Netlogon secure channel in a phased release explained in the Updates section. To provide AD forest protection, all DCs, must be updated since they will enforce secure RPC with Netlogon secure channel. This includes read-only domain controllers (RODC).

To learn more about the vulnerability, see CVE-2020-1472 (https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1472)."
      solution    : "From https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4557222/how-to-manage-the-changes-in-netlogon-secure-channel-connections-assoc#EnforcementMode

      The August 11, 2020 updates introduce the following registry setting to enable enforcement mode early. This will be enabled regardless of the registry setting in the Enforcement Phase starting on February 9, 2021:

      Registry subkey: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters
      Value: FullSecureChannelProtection
      Data type: REG_DWORD
      Data :
      1 - This enables enforcement mode. DCs will deny vulnerable Netlogon secure channel connections unless the account is allowed by the Create Vulnerable Connection list in the 'Domain controller: Allow vulnerable Netlogon secure channel connections' group policy.
      0 - DCs will allow vulnerable Netlogon secure channel connections from non-Windows devices. This option will be deprecated in the enforcement phase release.

      Reboot required?: No"
